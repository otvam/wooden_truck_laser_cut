## Inspiration

This model is inspired by the "Wooden Toy Car Unimog" by LuRhe (CC BY 4.0).
You can download this version on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3289565).
Here are the main differences between the proposed model and LuRhe's version:
* A CNC milling machine is not required, all the pieces can be laser-cutted.
* The model is more robust. Small features have been removed or reinforced.
* The model is symmetric (between the right and left sides).
* A towing hook has been added on the front and back.
